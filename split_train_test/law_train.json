During their first task, which involved scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage intentionally identifies Sova as a police officer to Anarchy 99's leader, Yorgi, in order to gain favor with the group. This tactic is further enhanced when Yorgi's brother Kolya reveals that he is a fan of Cage. Cage then tells Yorgi that he is in the club to make a deal about high-end sports cars, and hands him the list. Yorgi immediately identifies the tenth car on the list as an AI assistant, and Cage is able to use this information to his advantage.",
