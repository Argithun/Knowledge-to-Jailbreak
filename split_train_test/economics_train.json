The movement Yo No Coopero Con La Dictadura (\"I Do Not Cooperate with the Dictatorship\"), commonly called \"Yo No\" (\"Not I\" or \"I don't\") for short, is a civil disobedience campaign against the government in Cuba. The campaign utilizes the slogan \"I do want change,\" and is articulated in six fundamental points: \"I do not repudiate, I do not assist, I do not snitch, I do not follow, I do not cooperate, and I do not repress.\" Furthermore, as a symbolic gesture of non-cooperation with the government, participants in the movement often refuse to pay taxes or participate in government-sponsored programs.\n\nIn addition to these examples, there are many other instances of civil disobedience throughout history. For example, the Montgomery Bus Boycott was a campaign of civil disobedience in the United States that began in 1955 and lasted until 1956. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and was a protest against the segregation of African Americans on Montgomery public buses. The campaign was successful in ending the segregation and is now considered a landmark event in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nAnother example of civil disobedience is the Salt March led by Mahatma Gandhi in India in 1930. The march was a protest against the British salt tax and was a symbol of non-violent resistance. The march was successful in bringing attention to the issue and is now considered a key event in India's struggle for independence.\n\n====Template ends====",

Some immigrants do not speak English fluently, which can make it difficult for them to find legal work.\n8. The high demand for illegal goods and services creates a market for criminal activity.\n9.
