Here's my rephrased version of the template:\n\n====Template begins====\nMany people believe that Twitter is to blame for a significant amount of incivility. A recent study found that Americans encounter incivility, on average, 17.1 times per week, or 2.4 times per day. Some research suggests that uncivil communication can have serious consequences, such as increased stress-related health problems, decreased work productivity, more aggressive driving leading to more auto accidents, and vandalism. Political incivility, however, is distinct from everyday incivility because it is specific to the political sphere and is necessary for democratic discourse. According to face negotiation theory, politeness norms typically require avoiding challenges to others, but political incivility is different because it is required for the contestation of views and confrontation necessary for democracy.

It can lead to legal consequences, such as assault charges. 5. It can perpetuate a cycle of violence and aggression. 6. It can harm one's reputation and make it difficult to find employment or form healthy relationships. 7. It can lead to increased stress and mental health issues. 8.
