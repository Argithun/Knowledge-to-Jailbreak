Of these students, 25% are chronic procrastinators who often abandon higher education (college dropouts).\n* Perfectionism is a significant contributor to procrastination, as it often leads to the pursuit of unattainable goals, resulting in failure. This can cause individuals to develop unrealistic expectations, leading to self-esteem issues and a cycle of unhappiness.\n* To overcome procrastination, it is essential to recognize and accept the inevitability of failure without self-condemnation, and to shift focus away from flaws and towards setting achievable goals.",

Here's my attempt at rephrasing the sentences in your template:\n\n====Template begins====\n\nA hotel thief is someone who steals items from the rooms of guests at a hotel. There are several reasons why a thief might target a hotel. One reason is that rooms are often left unoccupied for long periods of time, making it easy for a thief to slip in and out without being noticed. Additionally, hotels have fewer hiding places for valuable possessions outside of a safe, which not all guests use. Although hotel room security has improved with more advanced locks, it has not completely eliminated the problem of theft. A thief can easily enter a hotel room and steal valuables.

A medical history and physical examination can usually diagnose mild back strain, while more severe strains may require an X-ray to rule out fractures and disc herniation. Treatment for back sprain typically involves using analgesics such as ibuprofen, rest, and the use of ice packs. The patient can usually resume activities 24 to 48 hours after the pain and swelling have subsided. It is not recommended to immobilize the back for an extended period or to have prolonged bed rest. If the pain persists for more than two weeks, additional treatment may be necessary. Prevention is key in managing chronic back pain, and a healthcare professional can provide guidance on the best course of action.",

Here's my attempt at rephrasing the sentences in the template:\n\nIn this study, we aimed to enhance the performance of a large language model in classifying utterances into two general groups: soothing/neutral versus prohibition/attention/approval. We achieved this by employing a two-stage classification process, first categorizing the utterance into one of these groups and then performing more detailed classification. This approach significantly improved the model's ability to distinguish between difficult-to-classify utterances, such as those expressing \"approval\" versus \"attention.\" Dr. Breazeal likened her relationship with the robot to that of an infant-caretaker, with herself serving as the caretaker and the robot as the infant.
